# HelloVue

Expanding my frontend toolkit by learning a new framework.

My first go in Vue using Vite & Pinia on a simple Todo app. Definitely over-engineered, but nice to play around with.
An opinionated framework approach takes a bit of getting used to coming from React, but enjoying it so far.

This has been a bit Pinia-heavy to start, so next I'll add some features to explore more of vanilla Vue. Once I'm happy
with that there are some a11y best-practices I want to include, as well as tweaking the light/dark themes.

## Project Setup

```sh
yarn
```

### Development

```sh
yarn dev
```

```sh
yarn build
```

```sh
yarn lint
```
