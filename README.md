# HelloVue

Expanding my frontend toolkit by learning a new framework.

My first go in Vue using Vite & Pinia on a simple Todo app. Definitely over-engineered, but nice to play around with.
An opinionated framework approach takes a bit of getting used to coming from React, but enjoying it so far.

This has been a bit Pinia-heavy to start, so next I'll add some features to explore more of vanilla Vue. Once I'm happy
with that there are some a11y best-practices I want to include, as well as tweaking the light/dark themes.

**UPDATE**

Spent some time tidying up the boilerplate and fixing a few of the theme colors that I'd broken. All seems a bit neater now.
Had fun implementing a light/dark theme toggle, adding a snazzy focus effect and making sure everything is keyboard accessible.

Added express and was looking at Heroku, but the free tier has disappeared so chucked it on netlify instead.

I think I'm done here - plenty of other ideas, but I've learned a bunch already. Will start another Vue project with a bit less
boilerplate if I want to explore further.
